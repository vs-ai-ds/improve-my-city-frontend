## 🔑 Key Features Deep Dive

### Centralized Filter Management

The application uses a centralized `useIssueFilters` hook that ensures all components (charts, lists, dropdowns) display the same filtered dataset. This provides a consistent user experience where:

- Status pie chart acts as a controller (toggle selection)
- Bar charts and issue list always show the same filtered data
- Filter chips display active filters with clear options
- All filters are synchronized across components

### Advanced Issue Management

**Quick Filters:**
- Unassigned issues
- Assigned to me (for staff)
- Overdue issues (past SLA)
- Needs attention (stalled > X days)

**Bulk Actions:**
- Select multiple issues with checkboxes
- Bulk assign to staff
- Bulk status change
- Bulk delete
- Export to CSV

**Age Indicators:**
- Real-time age calculation ("2 hours ago")
- Stalled indicator for issues with no updates
- Resolution time display for resolved issues

### Enhanced Issue Detail View

**Key Improvements:**
- Larger, more prominent title
- Colored status badges
- Embedded Google Maps with zoomable marker
